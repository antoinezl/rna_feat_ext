metagene_script.R : script that aims to write a FASTA file of the "metagenes" of each gene
Number of unique gene: 19 921
Number of unique transcripts: 95 274
>> Only the longest transcript for each gene is kept: if it is the longest, the short ones are part of the longest one.
Number of metagene retrieved and written in the txt/fasta file: 19 921

----
- Extraction of the attributes for the headers of the sequences (same script for cDNA)

- listeTrIDs.txt : File written by the previous script. Contains all the longest transcript ids
>> This file is then split into x smaller files containing each 4500 transcript ids

- 19 921/4500 = 5 files named 'xaa', 'xab', 'xac', 'xad' and 'xae'
>> These files are used as inputs in a loop to extract in a dataframe
	- gene exon sequence
	- gene id
	- transcript id
	- rank

- Merging of the previous dataframes (header attributes df and the last one)
by 3 colomns: 'ensembl_gene_id', 'ensembl_transcript_id' and 'rank'
/!\ IMPORTANT to merge by 'rank' column to make sure that the exon sequences are
written in the right order!!!
>> New dataframe named 'ToWrite' that will be used as an input in the next function:
'writeMetagene'

- Write a txt/FASTA file for each metagene

OUTPUT:
>> SeqMetagene.txt
>> Contains 19 921 metagenes (one for each gene)
